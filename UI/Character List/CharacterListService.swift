/// Protocol used to `abstract` or `remove`the concrete connection of this service and any class or struct that needs access to it

/// We are using this becasue it follows SOLID that is part of Model View, View Model design patern. We are abstracting the data to create a non concrete connection. Protocols and delegates are a 1:1 commuincation and they are an abstraction. It is best practice to use concrete with abstaction instead of conrete with a conrete object.
